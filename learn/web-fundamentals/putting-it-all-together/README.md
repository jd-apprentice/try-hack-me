# Putting It All Together

From the previous modules, you'll have learned that quite a lot of things go on behind the scenes when you request a webpage in your browser.

To summarise, when you request a website, your computer needs to know the server's IP address it needs to talk to; for this, it uses DNS. Your computer then talks to the web server using a special set of commands called the HTTP protocol; the webserver then returns HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc., which your browser then uses to correctly format and display the website to you.
